# 📚 Student Course Management System

> A Python-based command-line application built to manage students, courses, enrollments, and basic academic data as part of a first-year Computer Science project.

## 📖 Description

The **Student Course Management System** is a CLI application developed to practice core programming concepts in Python. It allows users to manage student records, course information, and enrollments through a simple and interactive menu-driven interface.

This project was built as part of my learning journey in Computer Science, with a focus on writing clean code, working with data structures, and understanding how small management systems are designed.
